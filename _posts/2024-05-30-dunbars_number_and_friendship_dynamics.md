In our journey to understand friendships, we often come across Dunbar's Number, a theory suggesting humans can maintain about 150 meaningful relationships. This concept, introduced by anthropologist Robin Dunbar, sheds light on the intricate dynamics of our social connections.

## The Hierarchy of Friendships

Dunbar's theory proposes a layered structure to our relationships:

- **5 Closest People:** These are individuals who provide the most emotional support, such as close family members or a best friend.
- **15 Close Friends:** People whose significant life events impact us deeply, forming an essential part of our social identity.
- **50 Good Friends:** Individuals you'd invite to significant events like parties.
- **150 Meaningful Contacts:** People you can engage in meaningful conversation with and feel connected to.
- **1,500 Acquaintances:** Those whose faces you recognize and names you might remember.

## The Dynamic Nature of Social Circles

Our social circles are constantly evolving. Life events such as moving to a new city, changing jobs, or significant personal changes can alter these circles. It's crucial to nurture these relationships, investing time and effort into maintaining them.

### Friendships in the Modern Era

Social media has expanded our acquaintance circle but often leads to superficial connections. While it facilitates maintaining long-distance relationships, the depth and quality of these connections can vary.

## Personal Insights

- **150 People:** Emily, a coworker, is a meaningful contact I enjoy talking to.
- **1,500 People:** Mike, a fellow gym member, is an acquaintance I recognize.

Language is a fluid entity that changes and evolves with society, and the business world is no exception. In this post, we will examine business jargon, those buzzwords and clichés often used in professional settings. While these terms can sometimes help us convey complex ideas succinctly, they can also create unnecessary complexity and confusion if not used appropriately.

## Why Do We Use Jargon?

In many industries, jargon is an unavoidable part of the job. It serves as a form of shorthand, simplifying complex concepts and allowing for efficient communication. For instance, terms like "bandwidth" and "leverage" are commonly used in business contexts, referring to the mental capacity to handle work and the ability to use resources effectively, respectively.

However, it's crucial not to overuse such phrases as they can confuse those who aren't familiar with them, leading to miscommunication and alienation.

## The Jargon Role Play Exercise

One effective way to understand and correctly use business jargon is through role-play exercises. Here's an example:

- Person A: Your outstanding work and effort really moved the needle for our company. At times, it seemed we didn’t have the bandwidth to tackle this challenge, but we managed because we always do.
- Person B: We’re grateful that you could handle this task and achieve such a great result for the company. Thank you for your consistent support throughout the project.

In this exercise, Person A uses jargon extensively, while Person B attempts to clarify their colleague's statements. By practicing such dialogues, we can better understand how to use jargon effectively and recognize when it might create confusion or tension.

In our digital age, social media has become a **pervasive** element of daily life, especially for the younger generation who are more **susceptible** to its impacts. As we reflect on our interactions with these platforms, it becomes clear that while they offer remarkable tools for connectivity, they can also lead to patterns of behavior such as **doomscrolling**. This habit of scrolling through endless feeds of negative news can affect our mental health, creating a **nagging feeling** of anxiety and despair.

To counteract this, some have turned to **abstinence** from social media—a digital detox of sorts—as a means to regain control and focus on well-being. It requires a conscious decision to refrain from the pull of notifications and the whirlwind of online discourse. The idea is not to **twist** our natural human desire for connection but to reshape it in a way that serves us, not the other way around.

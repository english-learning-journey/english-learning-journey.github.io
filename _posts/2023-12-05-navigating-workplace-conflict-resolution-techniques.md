This post explores the dynamics of workplace conflict and offers insights into how to approach it constructively.

## Understanding Workplace Conflict

**Conflict** arises when there is a clash of interests, values, actions, views, or directions. It can stem from a variety of sources, including:

- **Departmental Tensions**: Differences in goals or methods between departments can lead to friction.

## Introduction

We often dread the pile-up of tasks and responsibilities at work, fearing that we'll let people down if we don't meet expectations. Here we explore key strategies for improving productivity: Awareness, Observation, and Experimentation.

## Awareness: Don't Let Problems Fall Through The Cracks

The first step to improve productivity is awareness. Being aware of your productivity issues forces you to confront, rather than ignore, your current work habits. Ignoring problems in the hope that they will go away is a common but foolish approach. Going for a walk can even help you maintain this awareness, letting you reflect on your responsibilities and how you can meet them.

## Observation: Turning Over A New Leaf

Observation is the next step. By observing your habits, you can pinpoint the things that make you less productive. Perhaps your productivity decreases significantly when you receive that one dreaded email, turning your inbox into a mess. It's essential to intervene at the right moments to keep things in check. 

Once you've identified your problem areas through observation, the next step is to experiment with solutions.

## Experimentation: Never Get Twisted Up

Don't get twisted up in the vicious cycle of unproductivity. Experiment with different techniques to keep your tasks from piling up. For example, heading to a new coffee shop every time you need to clear a lot of emails can create a positive trigger, making you more focused on the task at hand.

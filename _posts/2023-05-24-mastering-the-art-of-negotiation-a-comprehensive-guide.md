Negotiating is a fundamental aspect of our everyday lives, whether we're discussing salary terms for a new job or simply deciding on a location for dinner. This skill is particularly crucial in the business world, where the ability to reach an agreement can make or break deals. For individuals who aren't natural negotiators, the process can be intimidating. But fear not! This post will provide a comprehensive guide to improving your negotiation skills, helping you to 'crush it' in your next negotiation session.

### Understanding Your Interlocutor

Your interlocutor is simply the person you're having the conversation with. Understanding their needs, aspirations, and concerns can help you build rapport and tailor your approach effectively. Remember, negotiation is not about winning against the other party but reaching an agreement that benefits both sides. 

### Know What You Want and What's Possible

Before entering into negotiations, be clear about your own needs and desires. Understand the worth of what you're asking for and don't be afraid to advocate for it. However, it's equally important to have a realistic understanding of what is achievable in your particular context. A little research can go a long way!

### Don't Assume and Always Communicate

Misgivings can often arise from misunderstandings. Don't assume that your efforts are acknowledged and appreciated without explicit communication. In a professional setting, use mechanisms like appraisals or weekly updates to ensure your contributions are recognised. Requesting feedback is also a good way to show that you're keen on learning and improving.

### Uncomfortable but Necessary Conversations

Money discussions, while often uncomfortable, are vital, particularly when negotiating salaries or pay raises. But, it's important not to let this work against you. Any raises you receive are likely based on your current salary, so negotiating your best offer from the get-go is crucial.

### Be Prepared for Rejections

Negotiations may not always turn out in your favour. It's important to anticipate this and be prepared with a plan B. Knowing when to walk away from the table is as essential as knowing when to push for more.

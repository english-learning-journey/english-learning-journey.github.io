Hello avid learners! Today, let's take an enthralling journey through space, focusing on meteorites, their collisions, and the wondrous phenomena they create in our night sky. You'll also learn some captivating vocabulary along the way!

## Meteorites: The Space Rocks

Meteorites are pieces of rock or metal that have fallen to Earth's surface from outer space. These space rocks are remnants from the early solar system and can tell us a lot about the universe. Not only scientists but also history enthusiasts find meteorites fascinating, as some religious artifacts are believed to contain meteorite fragments.

## Meteor Showers: A Stargazer’s Delight

Avid stargazers are often treated to the mesmerizing sight of meteor showers. As Earth passes through the tail of a comet, we get to see a large number of meteors entering Earth's atmosphere, creating a spectacle often referred to as shooting stars. These meteor showers are periodic and can be expected at certain times of the year.

## Collisions: The Impact

The collision of meteorites with Earth has led to various impacts - from creating giant craters to affecting the climate. For instance, the Vredefort crater in South Africa, which is approximately 300 kilometers wide, was created by the impact of a massive meteorite.

In our modern world, technology is both a boon and a potential source of chaos. Recently, a significant IT outage caused by a Windows update brought this dichotomy into sharp focus. The global disruption affected millions of users, grounding flights, halting healthcare services, and creating widespread confusion. This event highlights how reliant we are on technology and the consequences when it fails.

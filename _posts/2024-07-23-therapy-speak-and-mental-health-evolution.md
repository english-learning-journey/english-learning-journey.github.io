In recent years, the way we talk about mental health has evolved dramatically. This evolution has introduced what is often referred to as "therapy speak" into our everyday vocabulary. Terms like "setting boundaries," "gaslighting," and "self-care" have become common in conversations. While this shift has several benefits, it also comes with certain drawbacks.

### Changing Perceptions of Mental Health

Over the last couple of decades, people's approach to mental health has changed significantly. There is now more openness and willingness to discuss mental health issues. This change is driven by increased awareness, better access to information and resources, and efforts to reduce the stigma around mental health. Testimonial after testimonial from individuals who have benefited from therapy highlights its importance. As a result, mental health is no longer seen as a taboo topic but as an essential aspect of overall well-being.

### Diverse Views on Mental Health

Different groups view mental health through varied lenses. Teens are generally more open about their mental health struggles, often discussing them openly on social media. Older adults, on the other hand, may still carry some stigma and are less likely to seek help. Men are often hesitant to talk about their mental health due to societal expectations of stoicism, while women tend to be more proactive in seeking support and discussing their feelings.

### The Rise of Therapy Speak

Therapy speak has seeped into everyday language, both in English and in other languages. This phenomenon can be seen in phrases like "please respect my boundaries" and "you need to stop gaslighting me." While these terms can help articulate complex emotional states, their overuse or misuse can sometimes dilute their meaning and impact.

### Pros and Cons of Therapy Speak

#### Pros

#### Cons

### The Rescue Story: A Lesson in Preparedness

Some time ago, a 14-year-old boy ignored a yellow flag warning and ventured into the sea. The strong currents quickly pulled him away, leaving him struggling to stay afloat. Luckily, a drone pilot **discreetly** monitored the scene and deployed a drone equipped with a life vest. Despite rough waves, the pilot **retrieved** control and successfully dropped the vest near the boy, keeping him afloat until lifeguards arrived on a jet ski. 

This situation showcases how augmented technology, such as drones, can mitigate emergencies. Without this innovative tool, the boy could have succumbed to drowning—a chilling reminder of the importance of combining technology with human action.

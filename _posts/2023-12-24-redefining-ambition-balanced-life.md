In today's fast-paced world, the concept of ambition often becomes synonymous with relentless pursuit of success, often at the cost of personal well-being. This lesson invites us to explore the idea of redefining ambition, not as a ladder to climb, but as a path to balance and fulfillment.

### Vocabulary
- **Evident**: Clearly seen or understood; obvious.
- **Unbearable**: Not able to be endured or tolerated.
- **Toll on**: Having a negative effect over time.
- **Strive for**: To make a continuous effort towards a goal.
- **Going all out for**: Putting in maximum effort to achieve something.
- **Throw in the towel**: To give up or admit defeat.
- **Relentless**: Unceasingly intense.

In our discussions, we encountered various perspectives on ambition. The concept of downshifting emerged as a striking alternative to traditional career paths, advocating for a more balanced approach towards life and work. Stories and dialogues illustrated the the clear toll of an unbearable and relentless work culture and the liberation found in choosing to strive for personal contentment over societal expectations.

**Reflection**: What is your personal definition of ambition, and how does it align with your well-being? How do the pressures of societal norms influence our definitions of success?

We invite you to join this conversation and share your thoughts on the subject. How do you interpret ambition in your life?

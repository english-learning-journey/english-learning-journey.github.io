In the realms where sordid tyrants lurk and cruel winds whistle, there lies a chasm – a chasm where the heart of darkness seems to prowl. The mist emboldens the somber forest; the trees seem to twirl in an absent-minded dance, as if fiddling with the shadows. Suddenly, the clouds part, and the moon casts its silver bloom.

A solitary figure is seen peering through the shadows. It's a Valkyrie, the shepherd of fallen warriors. Her righteous soul is tormented by the burdens she carries. Each soul is a heavy burden, with its fate resting upon her almighty wings.

In the distance, a sinister lure plays its ominous tunes. These are no ordinary lures; they are ancient Scandinavian trumpets dating back to the Bronze Age, which were once wooden shepherd's horns. However, this night they seem to play a base and sordid tune seducing the darkness to consume the virtuous.

The Valkyrie, mustering her inner strength, counters the sinister notes of the lures. She flutters her wings, as she tends to her flock of spirits, guiding them towards the ethereal chambers of the afterlife. The onerous responsibility and the sacred duty for the sake of the fallen make her unwavering in her path.

As she approaches the sanctum, her heart almost succumbs to the darkness that now surrounds her. But, ajar in the chambers is a light so pure, it alights upon her being and draws her forward.

Suddenly, betrayed by a fellow Valkyrie, who apparently was seduced by the shadows, she is confronted with a choice: Retrace her steps and forsake her flock or fight the shadows and risk the wrath of the dark lords.

Her heart, beating like the twirl of a thousand wings, knows there is but one path. With a roar that shakes the very fabric of the realms, she charges through the darkness. The dark lur’s sinister tunes are drowned by the righteous symphony of her heart.

She emerges victorious; her flock safely shepherded into the light. Though her wings are tattered, her resolve is steel.

Through the shadows and through the lure of darkness, she proved that the righteous shall not falter. The burdens they bear, though onerous, are carried for the sake of purity and love. They are the beacon through the darkest nights, the unwavering light amidst the shadows.
